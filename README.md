# C/C++ Project 1 - Basic Syntax
AMS 595

Author: Abby Bindelglass

## Description
This project implements solutions to five C++ programming tasks. The first task translates a segment of code from MATLAB into C++. The second task prints a vector of integers. The third task uses a while loop to output all elements of the Fibonacci sequence that do not exceed 4,000,000. The fourth task consists of three parts. The first part makes a function that determines if a number is prime. The second part makes a function that finds all factors of a number. The third part makes a function that finds the prime factorization of a number. The fifth task prints the first n rows of Pascal's triangle by using iteration.

## Files
- `main.cpp` - contains source code for Questions 1-5
